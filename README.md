# HomeWhiz Integration for Home Assistant

![HomeWhiz icon](./icons/icon.png)

Integration for devices that can connect to HomeWhiz mobile app (Beko, Grundig, Arcelik)

## Installation

### Option 1. Using HACS (Recommended)

1. Search for `HomeWhiz` on the HACS integration page (this integration is part of the HACS default repository meaning it is not necessary to add this integration manually via custom repositories)
2. Install the integration and Restart Home Assistant

### Option 2. Manually

1. Using the tool of choice, open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory create a new folder called `HomeWhiz`.
4. Download _all_ files from the `custom_components/HomeWhiz/` directory in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory you created.
6. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

### Bluetooth 

1. Connect the device to the HomeWhiz app on your smartphone
2. Close the app
4. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations". The device should be automatically discovered. If it's not click "+" and search for "HomeWhiz"
5. Select the "Bluetooth" connection type 
6. Provide the HomeWhiz username and password. These will be used to fetch your device mapping from the HomeWhiz API during configuration. No internet connection is required after the initial configuration. 

### Wi-Fi

1. Connect the device to the HomeWhiz app on your smartphone
4. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations". Click "+" and search for "HomeWhiz"
5. Select the "Cloud" connection type 
6. Provide the HomeWhiz username and password.

Please note that the constant internet connection is required. Support for local connection is coming soon ([#52](https://github.com/rowysock/home-assistant-HomeWhiz/issues/52))

## Supported device types

The integration should theoretically work with all device types but was tested only with washing machines (Bluetooth) and Air Conditioning units (Wi-Fi). 
If you have other device type like Oven or Refigerator, please let us know.

If your device is missing some information, transtaltion or not working at all, please create an issue. 
Don't forget to include your device digital ID that can be found either in the HomeWhiz app or the integration logs. 

## Troubleshooting

### Bluetooth
Integration should work with all devices connected via Blueooth. Remember that the range of Bluetooth can be limited. If your device is out of range, you could try using an [ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy](https://esphome.github.io/bluetooth-proxies/).  

If you are using custom Home Assistant installation method like Virtual Machine, please make sure your system is configured properly and Bluetooth is available for the Home Assistant

The devices can support only single Bluetooth connection at a time.
To connect the device to the original app, you have to disable the Home Assistant integration. Restart Home Assistant and wait a few minutes - this should be indicated on the device: E.g. the Bluetooth icon on a washing machine starts flashing.

### Retrieve Integration Logs

To help us help you, please include integration logs when you submit issues. The integration supports multiple logging levels of which not all are shown in the Home Assistant log by default. To enable debug logging for this integration, please add the following configuration to your Home Assistant configuration.yaml file:
```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.homewhiz: debug
```
To retrieve logs, navigate in Home Assistant to: settings -> system -> logs and retrieve logs by e.g. pressing the download button below the logs.
